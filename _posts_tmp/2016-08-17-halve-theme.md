This website uses an adaptation of the Halve Jekyll theme, built by [@TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli) based on [@skeroble](https://github.com/srekoble)'s orginal work.

If you like it, just as I do, feel free to use it! The Halve Jekyll theme is free and open-source.

Also, you can find all the source code of this website [on my github](https://github.com/angelachieh/angelachieh.github.io).
