# About me

I am a French-Brazilian product manager working data and analytics. I have lived most of my life in SÃ£o Paulo and am currently a happy Parisian. I am passionate about all things tech, languages, [corgis](https://www.reddit.com/r/corgi/), burratas, and (so) many other things.

This is my personal page, where I share thoughts on anything that comes to my mind. Feel free to drop me a line at [angela.chieh@gmail.com](mailto:angela.chieh@gmail.com?Subject=Hi!).

This page was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a theme by [@TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli) based on [@skeroble](https://github.com/srekoble)'s orginal work. Images come from Unsplash, Lorem Pixel, or myself.
