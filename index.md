# About me

I am a French-Brazilian product manager working with data and analytics. I have lived most of my life in SÃ£o Paulo and am currently a happy Parisian. I am passionate about all things tech, languages, [corgis](https://www.reddit.com/r/corgi/), and (so) many other things.

Welcome to my page! Check out some of my personal projects on the top right corner. Feel free to drop me a line at [angela@chieh.co](mailto:angela@chieh.co?Subject=Hi!).

This page was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based on a theme by [@TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli) and [@skeroble](https://github.com/srekoble) (orginal work). Images come from Unsplash, Lorem Pixel, or myself.
